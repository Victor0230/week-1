         <h2>Reflection of module experience:</h2>
            <p>
                This report reflects on my experience developing a website using HTML and CSS, 
                focusing on achieving a harmonious integration of visual design and functional layout. 
                I prioritized creating an interface that is not only aesthetically engaging but also intuitive and user-friendly,
                 ensuring both form and purpose align seamlessly.
            </p>  


            <h2>How did I find the module?</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning, I was excited to dive into HTML, but I quickly felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of tags.
                 I made countless mistakes, for instance, forgetting to close a {div} or {main} tag,
                     which completely broke the page! But each bug taught me something valuable.
                      With every error and moment of frustration, I grew more comfortable with the basics of building a website.
                    When I moved on to CSS, I realized design is not just about picking colorsâ€”it's about visual hierarchy.
                     I spent hours tweaking margins and padding to achieve the perfect alignment.
                      As a perfectionist, I often couldn't resist adjusting elements that were already working fine,
                       which ironically led to broken layouts or new bugs in the code.
                    
       
            </p>    
        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
            <p>The project began by analyzing various existing websites to determine the optimal structure and layout.
                 Thanks to my prior experience in UI/UX design, conceptualizing and sketching a unique visual framework was relatively straightforward.
                Initially, I made a decision that might seem unusual from others perspectives:
                 I started practicing by recreating the Clairebook Zoo website to better understand how programming works and to gain hands-on experience.
                 After I got the necessary knowledge, I immediately started AS1.
                </p>

                <img src="images/practice_2.jpg" alt="Initial website ">
            <p>
                For my web portfolio, I didn't want to use a plain background color. 
                I attempted to create NASA-style starry effects or other dynamic visuals, but they proved too complex. In the end, 
                I chose to stick with what I knew. Inspired by practical lessons from my university coursework,
                 I developed an animated gradient background. This CSS makes the background shift colors smoothly. 
                 The gradient (deep blues/grays) slides side to side every 15 seconds, looping forever. Simple but modern!

        <h2>Validation screenshots! </h2>
        <p>I validated the HTML and CSS code using W3C Validator and W3C CSS Validator.
             The 8 screenshots below confirm that the pages comply with web standards, with no critical errors."
